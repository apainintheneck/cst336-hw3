# Nym Cloud
This is a website that creates thesaurus word clouds. Each word in the word cloud is clickable. The site pulls from the [Merriam-Webster Collegiate Thesaurus API](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-thesaurus) and it is deployed [here](https://apainintheneck.github.io/nym-cloud/).
